# Arduino
This repository includes several fundamental Arduino projects that were used to understand:

- Connecting sensors, LEDs, and servos, and programming their functional use.
- Reviewing and learning from the low level C and the underlying code in the Arduino programming library.
- Reviewing electrical engineering basics like circuitry, resistors and Ohm's law.
